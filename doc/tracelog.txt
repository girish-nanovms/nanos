Nanos contains a general-purpose tracing facility for instrumenting code
throughout the kernel. While the ftrace facility is designed to profile
function execution times, the tracelog records discrete entries of formatted
text accompanied by a timestamp, node (cpu) number, tag symbol to be used as a
handle, and optional attributes which allow tracing only entries that match a
given set of rules.

The tracelog was designed to minimize the cost of adding trace entries. Each
cpu has a dedicated trace buffer, avoiding the need to take a lock when adding
trace data, and only a single compare-and-swap operation is necessary to set a
"busy" bit (however this only fails on a race with a "collate" task replacing
the buffer with a new one, so it is conceivable that there might only ever be
a single "spin" iteration). Memory allocations for buffer space are designed
to occur within said collate task, scheduled either when an upper threshold of
buffer capacity has been reached or a request is made (currently only via
http) for trace data. That said, buffer allocations by the producer (via
buffer_extend) could occur as a last resort should a trace buffer reach
capacity before a collate task could exchange it with a new one.

The producer interface for the tracelog consists of two functions:

void tprintf(symbol tag, tuple attrs, const char *format, ...);
void vtprintf(symbol tag, tuple attrs, const char *format, vlist *ap);

These work like other formatted print functions in the kernel with the
addition of a tag symbol and an optional set of attributes that may be used to
filter trace entries prior to recording them in memory. The interface tries to
afford the user some flexibility in forming a trace entry by allowing it to be
built across multiple tprintf (or vtprintf) invocations; the trace entry is
terminated on a print ending with a newline. As such, each trace entry *must*
be terminated with a newline to be properly recorded.

As mentioned above, the collate task is scheduled to run as a result of either
a tracelog buffer nearing capacity or a request for up-to-date trace data
being received. It merges the individual cpu trace buffers that are first
pruned off of the cpuinfos (via a CAS with a fresh buffer), producing a linked
list of trace entries that may be finally consumed when the trace data is
downloaded. While the potential exists for keeping trace data resident in the
kernel and performing operations on that data in situ, the functionality is
currently limited to bulk downloading the trace data via a crude http
interface intended to be used with utilities like curl or wget. Trace data is
deleted as it is downloaded.

Tracelog support is built by specifying TRACE=tracelog on the make command
line. Tracing for individual parts of the kernel (enumerated in
src/debug_all.h) may be enabled via a comma-delimited list in the DEBUG make
variable, with DEBUG=all enabling tracing for all areas of the kernel. For
example,

   make TRACE=tracelog DEBUG=all run

runs Nanos with tracing everywhere in the kernel, while

   make TRACE=tracelog DEBUG=sched,pf run

runs with only scheduling and pagefault traces enabled.

The tracelog facility exposes a few parameters that may be configured within a
"tracelog" tuple in the root of the manifest:

disable: This flag disables tracing on bootup. This allows the user to
explicitly enable tracing (e.g. via the http interface, as described below)
when needed, avoiding the capture of unneeded trace data.

alloc_size: This specifies the size used to allocate new tracelog buffers,
defaulting to TRACELOG_DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE. Increasing the allocation size
will delay allocation of new buffers. This may be useful when tracing
timing-sensitive execution that would otherwise be disrupted by the collate
task and heap allocations for new trace buffers.

trace_tags: The presence of this tuple will cause trace entries to be recorded
only if they match specified tags and attributes. Each attribute of this tuple
represents a tag, and the associated value is either a flag, indicating that
all trace entries with such a tag should be recorded, or another tuple
representing which trace attribute(s) should be selected. For example, this
entry indicates that all trace entries with the "sched" and "thread" tags
should be recorded:

   tracelog:(trace_tags:(sched:t thread:t))

while this entry causes only threads with a tid of 2 to be recorded:

   tracelog:(trace_tags:(thread:(tid:2)))

A set of acceptable values for a trace attribute may be expressed using a
vector. This example will select thread traces for a tid of either 2 or 3:

   tracelog:(trace_tags:(thread:(tid:[2 3])))

Note that the tracelog configuration tuple is not parsed until after the
filesystem is mounted, so any trace entries recorded prior this point will not
have such filters applied.

Retrieving tracelog data:

An HTTP interface allows the tracelog to be retrieved as bulk data using a
program like curl or wget.

Trace data may be retrieved from a running Nanos image via the tracelog HTTP
interface:

$ curl -s -XGET http://127.0.0.1:9091/tracelog | tail
[2.998344, 0, virtio_net] input: len 152
[2.998344, 0, mutex] mutex 0xffffc0000045d0c0, wait 1, ra 0xffffffff80045bde

[2.998373, 0, mutex]    add ci 0xffff80010002a000 to tail, prev 0x0000000000000000

Trace entries are consumed when they are downloaded, so multiple requests may
be concatenated to form a complete log.

$ curl -s -XGET http://127.0.0.1:9091/tracelog > log
$ curl -s -XGET http://127.0.0.1:9091/tracelog >> log

There are some URI variants which allow control of tracing:

tracelog/enable - turns on tracing
tracelog/disable - turns off tracing
tracelog/clear - removes trace data stored in the kernel (does not affect enable state)
